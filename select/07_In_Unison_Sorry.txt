Everybody dreams alone
On their own
Privately
In unison
They fall asleep
And drop like flies
And make ends meet
And it makes me cry
It makes me cry
One day we're here
One day we're here
One day we die
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh
(Pow!)

When will you get 'round
To doing what you're supposed to?
When will you get 'round
To doing what you're supposed to?
(I'll get there soon)
When will you get 'round (Soon)
To doing what you're supposed to? (I'll get there soon)
When will you get 'round
To doing what you're supposed to? (Soon, soon)

Everybody dreams alone

And it makes me cry
It makes me cry
One day we're here
One day we–

When will you get round (Soon)
To doing what you're supposed to? (Soon, I'll get there soon)
When will you get round (I'll get there soon)
To doing what you're supposed to?
When will you get round (I'll get there soon)
To doing what you're supposed to? (Soon, soon, soon)
When will you get round (I'll get there soon)
To doing what you're supposed to? (Soon, soon)
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
