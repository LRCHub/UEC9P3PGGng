Made a noise invented a sound
When brian wilson used it a hit was found
If only I could have imagined
The square waves running through his head

Square wave - people couldn't believe it
Square wave - all the way to carnegie hall
Square wave

One rod for pitch
Electro magnetic fields
Wired up sing sing
Hung out with einstein

For all all of his brilliant innovation
Sent off to a siberian reservation
Square wave - people couldn't believe it
Square wave - all the way to carnegie hall
Square wave
