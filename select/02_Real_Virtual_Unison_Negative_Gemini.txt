We're doing it again this time
We're doing it again this time
We're doing it again this time
We're doing it again, anxiety

Put your hands upon me now
Like your life depends on it
We're doing it again
Do it inside, you
Put your hands upon me now
Like your life depends on it
We're doing it again
We're doing it inside

Come on, I'm lonely, you're a friend
Oh, don't you wanna say
Quit pushing me away
Your body
Put my hands around my neck
My life is in your grip
You know I make mistakes
But I matter
Come on, I'm lonely on rosé
I don't know what I've said
Quit pushing me away
Your body
Put my hands around my neck
My life is in your grip
You know I make mistakes
But I matter
